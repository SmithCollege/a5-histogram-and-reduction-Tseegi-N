What went well with this assignment?

In-class coding for reduction helped a lot for this assignment. 

What was difficult?

It was difficult to start the histogram part of the assignment as I wasn't sure how to approach it exactly.

How would you approach differently?

Go to office hours sooner

Anything else you want me to know?

It was fun to see the difference in results. I think it was the first graph from the homework that matched exactly to how I expected it to run.
